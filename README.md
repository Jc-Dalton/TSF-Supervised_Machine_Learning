At The Sparks Foundation internship, I tackled a project predicting student exam scores based on their study hours. The dataset was well-suited for linear regression, containing just two variables: hours studied and corresponding scores. To deepen my understanding, I decided to implement a linear regression algorithm from scratch rather than rely on existing libraries like scikit-learn.
